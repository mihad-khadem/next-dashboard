Perfect — so you want the **frontend README** rewritten to reflect that your app uses **Redux Toolkit (for state management)** and **Axios (for API requests)** — not Zustand/React Query.

Here’s your **final, production-grade `README.md`**, fully aligned with your project’s goals, structure, and backend integration plan.
It focuses on **Redux + Axios**, includes your **entire MVP requirements**, and sets a professional tone for GitHub.

## 🧱 Folder Structure
```

````

This structure supports **clean separation of concerns** and **scalable Redux logic**.

---

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mihad-khadem/pos_inventory_management_app_frontend.git

# 2️⃣ Move into project
cd pos_inventory_management_app_frontend

# 3️⃣ Install dependencies
npm install

# 4️⃣ Start the development server
npm run dev
````

Then open 👉 **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

---

## 🧩 Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=POS Dashboard
```

---

## 🧠 State Management (Redux Toolkit)

The app uses **Redux Toolkit** for state management with **Slices** and **Async Thunks**.
Each module (products, sales, reports, etc.) has its own slice to keep logic isolated.

Example slice (`redux/slices/authSlice.ts`):

```ts
import { createSlice, createAsyncThunk } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import axios from "@/lib/axiosClient";

export const loginUser = createAsyncThunk("auth/login", async (credentials) => {
  const { data } = await axios.post("/auth/login", credentials);
  return data;
});

const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: "auth",
  initialState: { user: null, token: null, loading: false },
  reducers: {
    logout: (state) => {
      state.user = null;
      state.token = null;
    },
  },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(loginUser.pending, (state) => {
        state.loading = true;
      })
      .addCase(loginUser.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.loading = false;
        state.user = action.payload.user;
        state.token = action.payload.token;
      })
      .addCase(loginUser.rejected, (state) => {
        state.loading = false;
      });
  },
});

export const { logout } = authSlice.actions;
export default authSlice.reducer;
```

---

## 🔄 API Integration (Axios)

Axios is pre-configured with interceptors for **JWT token handling** and **error management**.

Example (`lib/axiosClient.ts`):

```ts
import axios from "axios";

const axiosClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
});

axiosClient.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("accessToken");
  if (token) config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return config;
});

axiosClient.interceptors.response.use(
  (res) => res,
  (err) => Promise.reject(err.response?.data || err.message)
);

export default axiosClient;
```

## 🤝 Contribution Guide

> **Note to Contributors:**
>
> - Use **Redux Toolkit** for state management.
> - Place new features inside `/app/{module}` folders.
> - Use **Axios Client** from `lib/axiosClient.ts` for API calls.
> - Follow existing folder & naming conventions.
> - Keep UI consistent with existing components.
> - Always wrap async calls with proper error handling.
